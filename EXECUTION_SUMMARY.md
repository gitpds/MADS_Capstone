# Execution Summary - Consumer Sentiment Analysis Project

## Completed Tasks (Steps 1-3)

### ✅ Step 1: Run Diagnostic Notebook
- **File**: `diagnostic_analysis_executed.ipynb`
- **HTML Output**: `diagnostic_analysis_results.html` (671 KB)
- **Key Findings**:
  - Identified severe multicollinearity (26 highly correlated feature pairs)
  - Confirmed stationarity of UMCSENT (p-value < 0.05)
  - Baseline models achieved R² between -1.85 and -0.85
  - Original features focused too heavily on standardized levels
  - Recommended using 5-8 economically diverse features

### ✅ Step 2: Run Final Analysis Notebook
- **File**: `consumer_sentiment_analysis_final_executed.ipynb`
- **HTML Output**: `consumer_sentiment_analysis_final_results.html` (883 KB)
- **Results**:
  - Created 16 economically-driven features
  - Selected 8 diverse features based on economic theory
  - Model performance still negative but improved from -3.3 to around -2.5
  - Established proper baseline comparisons
  - Completed all required sections (ethics, references, etc.)

### ✅ Step 3: Convert to HTML for Submission
Both notebooks have been successfully converted to HTML with all outputs:
1. `diagnostic_analysis_results.html` - Shows the investigation process
2. `consumer_sentiment_analysis_final_results.html` - Main submission file

## Critical Issue Identified

The models are still showing negative R² values, which means they perform worse than simply predicting the mean. This is a fundamental issue that needs addressing before final submission.

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Simplified Approach (Recommended)
1. Use only 3-5 most correlated features
2. Try simple linear regression first
3. Focus on change features (mom, yoy) not levels
4. Consider log transformations for skewed variables

### Option 2: Time Series Specific Models
1. Implement ARIMA models
2. Try Vector Autoregression (VAR)
3. Use sentiment lags as features

### Option 3: Reframe the Problem
1. Predict sentiment direction (up/down) instead of exact values
2. Focus on extreme sentiment periods only
3. Use ensemble of simple models

## Files Created for Submission

1. **README.md** - Complete setup and run instructions ✅
2. **requirements.txt** - All Python dependencies ✅
3. **STATEMENT_OF_WORK.md** - Team contributions ✅
4. **consumer_sentiment_analysis_final.ipynb** - Main analysis ✅
5. **diagnostic_analysis.ipynb** - Diagnostic tools ✅
6. **HTML outputs** - For viewing results ✅

## Next Immediate Step

Before submitting, you MUST fix the negative R² issue. The simplest approach:

```python
# Use only top 3-5 features by correlation
top_features = X.corrwith(y).abs().nlargest(5).index
X_simple = X[top_features]

# Try simple linear regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
# ... rest of modeling
```

The current analysis is comprehensive and meets all requirements EXCEPT for having positive model performance. This must be fixed for a passing grade.
