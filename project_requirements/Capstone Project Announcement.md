Capstone Project Announcement

The core of this class is a group data science project which will be independently designed and executed by students. The intention is to create a resume-worthy portfolio project in a format that is ready to share and present with the broader community of data science professionals. 

### The project

You’ll be working in groups to create a data science project that

* you could never do alone,  
* you could never have done before MADS,  
* you could never have imagined getting three months of protected time to work on\!

You are encouraged to pick a topic that is exciting to you personally. This course is a playground to chase a really wild idea you’ve had in the back of your mind for a few months, or to dig deep into a method that you hope to make a cornerstone of your professional identity. As such, the instructional team is open to a very, very wide range of projects\! We’re not looking for a one-size-fit-all set of techniques or a kind of dataset; we’re looking for evidence that you pushed your boundaries as a data scientist and made something that demonstrates mastery of your domain.

If you’re not sure what kind of project you’d like to do, that’s also okay. The MADS Instructional team will provide a few datasets that you can work with if you don’t want to propose something new- [check out the list here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ibc_foCaiZNrNT-7h5p2yo5JNM_iZzdF1nb6P3maa-4/edit?usp=sharing). 

Some ideas:

* Pursue a work of data journalism. Investigate a dataset for something of social, cultural, or political interest and create a report in the vein of outlets like the New York Times, Five Thirty Eight, or The Pudding.  
* Create a full-stack data science application, like an interactive data dashboard or a prediction engine that users can engage with over a browser.  
* Pick a research topic where you think data science techniques can have an impact and build a proof-of-concept (you can even aim to write a scientific paper).  
* Write an open-source library that addresses a data science headache that’s plagued you the last few years.  
* Create a data-driven report for a business or industry of your choice with forecasting and insights from novel techniques or datasets.

#### Forming a group

Groups of 3 are ideal. If it is appropriate for your project, we will also accept teams of 2 or 4\.  Most modern data science is teamwork, and learning to collaborate asynchronously is an essential skill for every data scientist. The Slack channel \#siads699\_ss25\_234\_team\_matching is set up to help you find a team. 

In rare circumstances, we’ll approve a solo project. You may petition to work independently via [the solo project proposal form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAlc6-u9OeIdeL0IzxXRtSdnC07zPO-vzvLKG7NCtqt2q1kA/viewform?usp=header). Because group work is essential to the learning objectives of the course, we do not make exceptions for personal preferences to work solo. An example where we might approve a solo project is an ongoing work-related project similar in scope to a Capstone that is directly supervised by a mentor at your job. 

#### Proposing a project

#### After your team is formed, you will need to propose a project. This activity is in Module 2 of the Coursera shell. Your proposal will be reviewed by the teaching team, and we’ll offer feedback to help you shape your approach. 

#### Choosing a dataset

You can use one dataset or several. We will be evaluating proposals to ensure that the proposed dataset is appropriate for the questions you hope to answer.

Please make sure your data meets the following criteria:

- All team members must be able to access the data.   
- The instructional team does not need access to your raw data, but we must be able to see your code and any analyses. **Faculty are not allowed to sign data usage agreements or non-disclosure agreements**.  
- Your project respects any licenses or usage agreements attached to your dataset.  
- Due to the short turnaround time of the Capstone, we cannot support projects that require a new IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval. This includes projects that collect sensitive, personally-identifiable or biomedical data. If you are unsure, please read the [IRB website](https://research-compliance.umich.edu/irb-application-process).

#### Deliverables

You’re going to be asked to turn in a few things at the end of the course:

* A blog post that tells the story of your project. Blogging is one of the most popular ways working data scientists share their ideas, network, and find jobs. While you don’t have to actually publish your blog, you’ll need to turn in something that’s both interesting to a broad audience of data professionals and technically accurate. *Note: if you’re aiming to write a scientific paper, a draft of that paper can count. Just make sure it’s readable to non-experts\!*  
* A GitHub repository full of the code required to reproduce your analysis and figures. Your repository should be documented with a welcoming, informative README so a data scientist from outside MADS could understand what you did\!

And one of the following high-level overviews of your work designed to be shared:

* A 3-5 minute video from your team about what you made.   
* A poster appropriate for a data science conference, such as the [MIDAS Data Science Symposium.](https://midas.umich.edu/2020-symposium/)

#### Project Grading Policy

Because there is no one-size-fits-all Capstone project, and no one-size-fits-all measure of success, the final project is assessed with specifications grading. Specifications grading means that projects that accomplish a minimum set of requirements receive full credit. You can read about the specifications [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15S0W_qQB2YsKfo7q8ujoilqUDtY18OVvxckc9l4J0dk/edit?usp=sharing) 

Receiving full credit doesn’t mean there is no room for improvement- the teaching team will still offer you constructive feedback on your project. And in the last week of class, you will share your work in the \#capstone-gallery Slack channel as part of a virtual poster session. By participating in the gallery, you’ll have the chance to receive feedback from members of the UMSI community. 

#### Communication Policy

As much as possible, please ask questions in the main course channel (\#siads699\_ss25\_234). 9/10 times someone else will have your question and it benefits everyone to make the answers visible.

If you are concerned that one of your grades in the gradebook looks incorrect, please DM course manager @Kirtana Choragudi.

If you DM the instructional team, please message all of us. If you only message one of us we'll probably ask you to rewrite the message with the other instructors. 

FAQs

**Will the Capstone have a similar structure to Milestones where once we submit a proposal, there will be peer feedback, before we submit a ‘final’ proposal for the instructors?**

Proposals will be reviewed by instructors and either given approval or asked for revisions. There is no peer feedback.

**If we decide to post in the form of a blog post, do you have any suggestions/preferences on where to host the blog?**

No preferences. Medium or a GitHub pages site are great starting points.

**If we decide to post a full stack with a dashboard in a website, do you have any suggestions/preferences on where to host the website as well?**

No preferences. Heroku is a great place for lightweight dashboards. If you have more intense data/computing needs, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform might be the right place to look.

**Are there any cloud computing resources available to us?**

Everyone can play with AWS through Vocareum. You will receive a $200 credit by default.

Other tools students have used include Google Collab (which gives you up to 12 hours of free GPU/TPU time per session), DeepNote, and Google Cloud Services (which gives all new users $300 credit). 

Please note that the teaching team cannot provide support or troubleshooting for cloud resources. Cloud computing skills are outside the learning objectives of this class.  If you don’t already have experience with AWS or a similar cloud platform, it is usually not worth the added complexity to your project. The teaching team is happy to advise if you’re not sure.
