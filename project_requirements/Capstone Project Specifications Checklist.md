  **Capstone Project Specifications**

**EVERYONE \- Please note this is for everyone \- be sure to download your own copy for revising.**

Capstone projects are highly individualized, and there is no single definition of success. To promote curiosity and risk-taking, we will be using specifications grading to assess your final projects. In this framework, all projects that meet the minimum requirements, specified in the checklist below, receive full credit. Of course, we expect you will go beyond the minimum\! 

When you turn in your work on Coursera, you will be asked to confirm these specifications have been met. If in doubt, please ask your project advisor ahead of time. 

- [ ] A **GitHub repository** containing  
      - [ ] A README file that documents how to run your code   
      - [ ] A requirements.txt file listing all of the libraries needed to run your code, and only those libraries.  
      - [ ] Code that generates results and figures in your report  
      - [ ] Cleaned code: unused code blocks and files removed, absolute file paths converted to relative paths, and personal keys (e.g. API) removed.  
      - [ ] A data access statement indicating how to access the data or explaining who owns the data. Licenses for data use and redistribution are respected.  
      - [ ] In-line code attributions for any code segments your team did not write or received external assistance to create. If code is reused from an open source project, licenses are respected.  
- [ ] A **3-5 minute video summary** or **poster** about the highlights of your project  
- [ ] A **written report** about your work. We strongly suggest keeping the report under 3000 words (excluding bibliography and appendix). Your report should meeting the following specifications:  
      - [ ] **Project statement:** your report explains the problem you attempted to solve at a level appropriate for a broad audience.  
      - [ ] **Methodology:** your report explains how you attempted to solve the problem and justifies your methodological approach.  
      - [ ] **Evaluation strategy:** your report defines what a successful outcome would be and includes a critical evaluation of your work following an appropriate strategy.  
      - [ ] **Technical depth:** your report demonstrates mastery of learning objectives from multiple MADS courses.   
      - [ ] **Translation:** your report interprets the outcome of your work. Numerical results are translated to insight on your problem.   
      - [ ] **Broader impacts:** your report identifies who stands to be impacted by your work.  You identify at least one ethical question or concern that could arise from your work or its potential applications.  
      - [ ] **Appropriate technical writing:** your writing is clear, professional, and accurately reflects your work. Writing avoids overstatement.   
      - [ ] **Visuals:** your report includes at least 3 original, legible, data visualizations. Visuals are explained and integrated in the body of the report.  
      - [ ] **Context:** your report includes information from at least 3 studies, blogs, academic articles, or other sources that are relevant to your project. All references in your report are correctly formatted with a consistent citation style (such as MLA or APA) in-text as well as in a dedicated “References” section.   
      - [ ] **Statement of work:** your report contains a statement identifying the contributions of each team member.  
      - [ ] **Incorporating feedback:** Your report builds on feedback from your project mentor. Major issues identified during check-ins are addressed.  
      - [ ] **(Optional) An appendix:** Show us what you left out. Create an appendix to describe any other efforts you made that did not get included in the main report.   
- [ ] A post in the **\#capstone-gallery** channel to share your video, poster, and/or blog
